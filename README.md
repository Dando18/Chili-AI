Chili AI
--------

Scripts for learning to generate recipes from a dataset of recipes.
These were designed for chili in particular, but you could use any recipe 
dataset.
The scripts support learning with several types of data tokenization, LSTM 
models, and hidden markov chain models.
Run `python3 main.py --help` to see the available options.
See [this repo](https://github.com/Dando18/Recipe-ML) for my previous 
implementations using TensorFlow and just LSTMs.
